You're debugging a tricky race condition when you need to check whether your fix
breaks any tests. In a typical setup, you'd lose your context: switch windows,
wait for the test runner, then try to remember where you were. With tmux, Claude
Code opens a new pane, runs `npm test`, and reports back while your debugging
session stays untouched.

This kind of parallel workflow is why tmux pairs so well with AI coding
assistants. This tutorial covers the fundamentals and practical patterns for
organizing your development sessions.

## Why tmux Works So Well with AI Coding Assistants

Traditional IDEs control the UI through complex APIs, plugins, and extension
systems. tmux takes a different approach: **everything is controlled through
bash commands**.

This matters for AI coding assistants because:

1. **No context switching penalty.** Claude Code can run tests, start servers,
   or check logs in separate panes without interrupting your current view.
   Switching between views is just changing what text gets displayed.

2. **Bash commands are the control interface.** Claude Code can run
   `tmux split-window -h` to create a side-by-side view, or
   `tmux select-window -t build` to switch context. The same interface you use
   is the interface the agent uses.

3. **Everything is scriptable.** Claude Code can set up your entire development
   environment, create monitoring dashboards with multiple panes, or tear down
   processes across windows, all through simple commands.

4. **Sessions persist.** If your SSH connection drops or you close your
   terminal, the tmux session keeps running. Long-running agent tasks survive
   disconnects.

## Core Concepts

If you're new to tmux, here's what you need to know:

- **Session**: A collection of windows. Think of it as a workspace for a
  specific project or task.
- **Window**: A full-screen view within a session. Like browser tabs.
- **Pane**: A subdivision of a window. Split horizontally or vertically to see
  multiple things at once.

The hierarchy: `session > window > pane`

## Getting Started

Install tmux:

```bash
# macOS
brew install tmux

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install tmux

# Fedora
sudo dnf install tmux
```

Start your first session:

```bash
tmux new-session -s myproject
```

You're now inside tmux. The green bar at the bottom confirms it.

## Essential Commands

tmux commands can be run from outside tmux (prefixed with `tmux`) or from inside
using the prefix key (default: `Ctrl+b`) followed by a command key.

### Session Management

```bash
# Create a new session
tmux new-session -s sessionname

# Create session with specific working directory
tmux new-session -s sessionname -c ~/projects/myapp

# List sessions
tmux list-sessions

# Attach to existing session
tmux attach -t sessionname

# Detach from current session (from inside tmux)
# Press: Ctrl+b, then d

# Kill a session
tmux kill-session -t sessionname
```

### Window Management

```bash
# Create new window (from inside tmux)
# Press: Ctrl+b, then c

# Create window with specific name
tmux new-window -n build

# Switch to window by number
# Press: Ctrl+b, then 0-9

# Switch to window by name
tmux select-window -t windowname

# Rename current window
tmux rename-window newname
# Or press: Ctrl+b, then ,

# List windows
tmux list-windows
```

### Pane Management

```bash
# Split into top/bottom panes
tmux split-window -v

# Split into left/right panes
tmux split-window -h

# Navigate between panes
# Press: Ctrl+b, then arrow keys

# Close current pane
# Press: Ctrl+d (or type 'exit')

# Zoom current pane (toggle fullscreen)
# Press: Ctrl+b, then z
```

<Note>
The flag names are counterintuitive: `-v` creates a **v**ertical split line
(resulting in top/bottom panes), while `-h` creates a **h**orizontal split line
(resulting in left/right panes). Think about the direction of the dividing line,
not the arrangement of the panes.
</Note>

## Patterns for AI-Assisted Development

Now that you know the basics, here are patterns that are especially useful when
working with Claude Code.

### Pattern 1: Dedicated Windows for Different Tasks

Create named windows so Claude Code can run processes without interrupting your
current view:

```bash
# Start a session for your project
tmux new-session -s myapp -c ~/projects/myapp

# Create windows for different tasks
tmux new-window -n server
tmux new-window -n tests
tmux new-window -n logs
```

With this setup, you can ask Claude Code to "start the dev server" and it will
run:

```bash
tmux send-keys -t myapp:server 'npm run dev' Enter
```

The server starts in its own window. Your current view is unaffected.

### Pattern 2: Running Tests Without Losing Context

The most common use case: you're in the middle of editing when you want to check
if your changes break anything.

```bash
# Claude Code can run tests in the background and capture output
tmux send-keys -t myapp:tests 'npm test' Enter

# Then check the results
tmux capture-pane -t myapp:tests -p | grep -E "(PASS|FAIL|Error)"
```

Claude Code can then report "3 tests passing, 1 failing in auth.test.js" without
you ever leaving your current context.

### Pattern 3: Side-by-Side Code and Output

When you do want to see output live, split the window:

```bash
# Create left/right panes
tmux split-window -h

# In the right pane, run your test watcher
npm test -- --watch
```

You edit on the left, tests run on the right. Claude Code can work in either
pane.

### Pattern 4: Monitoring Multiple Services

For microservices or multi-process applications, create a monitoring dashboard:

```bash
# Create a 4-pane layout
tmux new-session -s monitor -d
tmux split-window -h
tmux split-window -v
tmux select-pane -t 0
tmux split-window -v

# Start services in each pane
tmux send-keys -t monitor:0.0 'docker logs -f api' Enter
tmux send-keys -t monitor:0.1 'docker logs -f worker' Enter
tmux send-keys -t monitor:0.2 'docker logs -f frontend' Enter
tmux send-keys -t monitor:0.3 'htop' Enter
```

Claude Code can set this up for you, or you can create a script that does it.

## Advanced: tmux + Git Worktrees

Git worktrees let you check out multiple branches simultaneously in separate
directories. Combined with tmux, you can work on multiple features without
stashing, branch switching, or waiting for file changes.

This is powerful when working with Claude Code on larger projects. You might
have Claude Code working on a refactor in one session while you review a bug fix
in another, each with its own running dev server and test watcher.

### The Setup

A worktree is just a separate checkout of your repo. Given a repository at
`~/dev/myproject`, you can create a worktree for a feature branch:

```bash
cd ~/dev/myproject
git worktree add ../myproject-feature feature/new-auth
```

Now `~/dev/myproject-feature` contains your feature branch. Each worktree is
independent: different files, different `node_modules` (if you run install),
different running processes.

### Pairing Worktrees with tmux Sessions

Create a tmux session for each worktree:

```bash
# Create the worktree
git worktree add ../myproject-feature feature/new-auth

# Create a tmux session for it
tmux new-session -d -s feature -c ~/dev/myproject-feature

# Set up windows
tmux new-window -t feature -n server
tmux new-window -t feature -n tests

# Attach to start working
tmux attach -t feature
```

### Switching Contexts

With this setup, switching between feature branches is instant:

```bash
# Working on feature A in the 'feature' session
tmux attach -t feature

# Need to check main? Detach (Ctrl+b, d) then:
tmux attach -t main
```

No stashing, no checkout delays. Each session has its own processes running.

### Cleanup

When you're done with a feature:

```bash
tmux kill-session -t feature
git worktree remove ../myproject-feature
```

## Configuration Tips

Create `~/.tmux.conf` to customize tmux:

```bash
# Use Ctrl+a instead of Ctrl+b (easier to reach)
set -g prefix C-a
unbind C-b
bind C-a send-prefix

# Start window numbering at 1
set -g base-index 1

# Enable mouse support
set -g mouse on

# Increase scrollback buffer
set -g history-limit 10000

# Split panes using | and -
bind | split-window -h
bind - split-window -v

# Reload config with r
bind r source-file ~/.tmux.conf \; display "Config reloaded!"
```

After creating or modifying this file:

```bash
# Reload configuration
tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf
```

## Quick Reference

| Action                     | Command / Keybinding             |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| New session                | `tmux new -s name`               |
| List sessions              | `tmux ls`                        |
| Attach to session          | `tmux attach -t name`            |
| Detach                     | `Ctrl+b, d`                      |
| New window                 | `Ctrl+b, c`                      |
| Next/prev window           | `Ctrl+b, n` / `Ctrl+b, p`        |
| Split top/bottom           | `Ctrl+b, "` or `tmux split-window -v` |
| Split left/right           | `Ctrl+b, %` or `tmux split-window -h` |
| Navigate panes             | `Ctrl+b, arrow keys`             |
| Zoom pane                  | `Ctrl+b, z`                      |
| Kill pane                  | `Ctrl+d` or `exit`               |
| Rename window              | `Ctrl+b, ,`                      |

## Next Steps

Once you're comfortable with the basics:

1. **Explore plugins**: [tmux Plugin Manager (tpm)](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm)
   adds features like session restore, better copy mode, and more.
2. **Try session managers**: [tmuxinator](https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator)
   lets you define layouts in YAML and spin them up with a single command.
3. **Script your workflows**: Create shell functions that set up your project's
   tmux environment automatically.

The key insight: tmux's command-driven interface means Claude Code can organize
your workspace as easily as it can edit files. That turns your terminal into a
genuinely collaborative environment.
