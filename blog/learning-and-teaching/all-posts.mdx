**[Lessons from Teaching My SAT Reading Series at schoolhouse.world](/blog/learning-and-teaching/first-shw-sat-reading-series)**

My experience teaching a free 8-week SAT Reading series at schoolhouse.world in

habits (tracking pronouns, identifying transitions, etc.) were far more
effective than traditional test-prep, keeping students engaged while building
transferable skills.
