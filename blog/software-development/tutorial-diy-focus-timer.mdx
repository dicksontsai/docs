There are tons of websites already that cover how to block websites on MacOS
using the
[/etc/hosts](https://tldp.org/LDP/solrhe/Securing-Optimizing-Linux-RH-Edition-v1.3/chap9sec95.html)
file.

The key insight here is that **you can treat /etc/hosts like any other file**.
You can copy it, write another file's contents into it, etc. using the familiar
Bash commands cp, mv, etc.

In this script, we use Bash to write additional websites to /etc/hosts, set a
timer, and then revert /etc/hosts back to its original contents.

USE THIS SOLUTION AT YOUR OWN RISK. Exercise to the reader: can you think of one
thing that a malicious person target in this script? Consider always checking
the content of your files before you use sudo.
