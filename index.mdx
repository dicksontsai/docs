## About Me

I am a Software and Data Engineer at Anthropic working on Claude Code. Previously, I worked at Google on various data infrastructure and machine learning projects.

Beyond my professional work, I am passionate about education. I provide free SAT tutoring through [schoolhouse.world](https://schoolhouse.world), helping students from all backgrounds achieve their academic goals.

When I'm not coding or teaching, you'll find me exploring new board games with friends.
