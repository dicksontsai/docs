Hello, welcome to my website!

I am currently a product engineer on
[Claude Code](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code) at
[Anthropic](https://anthropic.com). Before Claude Code, I worked on pre-training
dataset research, specifically on text quality filtering, image datasets, and
image-text interleaved datasets.

Prior to Anthropic, I was a Growth Engineer at Google Search, specializing in
sequence/funnel analysis, A/B testing, and logging.

I graduated from [UC Berkeley](https://berkeley.edu) in 2016 with majors in
Computer Science and Linguistics.

In my spare time, I like to explore new board games, catch up on the latest
sports results, and watch game/competition shows.
